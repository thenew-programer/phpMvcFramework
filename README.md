# PHP MVC FRAMEWORK
I want to learn php so I guess the perfect plan is to build something with it, so I got this idea from youtube how to build a PHP FRAMEWORK from scratch and I kinda like it. This framework is little bit biased because I'm comming from Nodejs express and I like the way express handle requests, and I almost do the same thing, feel free to check it out and give me your feedback.
